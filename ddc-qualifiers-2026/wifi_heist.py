#
#   THE STORY:
#   ----------
#   The IT guy at school just changed the WiFi password.
#   Again. For the 4th time this month.
#
#   Nobody knows the new password, the printer queue is
#   dead, and people are burning through their mobile data
#   watching TikToks in the cafeteria.
#
#   BUT... your friend found this Python script on a USB
#   stick the IT guy left behind. It's the script he uses
#   to scramble the WiFi password before storing it.
#
#   You also found the scrambled password he saved
#   (see 'scrambled_password' below).
#
#   YOUR MISSION:
#   Reverse the scramble. Get the password. Be the hero.
#   The flag is in the format DDC{...}
#
#   HINT: The IT guy did 3 steps to hide the password.
#   Just UNDO each step... in REVERSE order!
#   (undo step 3 first, then step 2, then step 1)
#
#   You got this.
#
# ================================================================


def it_guy_scramble(password):
    """This is how the IT guy hides the WiFi password."""

    # STEP 1: Shift every character forward by 3
    # (each letter becomes the letter 3 places ahead)
    shifted = []
    for char in password:
        shifted.append(chr(ord(char) + 3))

    # STEP 2: Flip the whole thing backwards
    backwards = shifted[::-1]

    # STEP 3: Mix each character with the IT guy's
    # favorite number (42) using XOR
    magic_number = 42
    mixed = []
    for char in backwards:
        mixed.append(ord(char) ^ magic_number)

    return mixed


def unscramble(scrambled):
    # every character was XOR'd with 42, which is undone by just doing it again?
    # note: if we assume source was unicode chars (like I think is done for the scrambling anyway), we also know that 42 is not a integer value which would change the byte length of the unicode character, since 42 is not 0b1xxxxxx: https://stackoverflow.com/a/33349765
    backwards = []
    for byte in scrambled:
        backwards.append(chr(byte ^ 42))

    shifted = backwards[::-1]

    unscrambled = []
    for char in shifted:
        unscrambled.append(
            chr(ord(char) - 3)
        )  # I assume this is easily reversible for the source, given they do not round this

    return unscrambled


# ============================================================
#  THIS is the scrambled password found on the USB stick!
#  Reverse the steps above to decode it.

# ============================================================
#  YOUR SOLVE SCRIPT GOES HERE!
#
#  Think about it:
#    - The LAST thing the IT guy did was Step 3 (XOR).
#      So the FIRST thing you undo is... the XOR!
#    - Then undo Step 2 (the reversal)
#    - Then undo Step 1 (the shift)
#
#  Useful Python reminders:
#    chr(number)  -> gives you a character
#    ord(char)    -> gives you a number
#    a ^ b        -> XOR operation
#    list[::-1]   -> reverses a list
#
#  Uncomment and fill in the line below when you have the flag:
# check_flag("DDC{???}")
# ============================================================
